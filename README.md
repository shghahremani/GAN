# GAN
Overview
We used generative adversarial networks (GANs) to do anomaly detection for time series data. We also developed attention based LSTM to identify time delay attack attributes.

Data

We have two kind of dataset as following:
DataSet for Gan Network:
In order to train GAN network first we need to train the model with normal data which has been generated by Powerword simulator. In this case the data only contains the natyral noise.
